```

### Gemini Response:
This is a good start as it clearly states the problem and offers alternatives. To make it even better and more user-friendly, consider these improvements:

1.  **Soften the opening:** "❌ No data found" can feel a bit abrupt.
2.  **Explain (briefly):** While you might not know the exact technical reason, a general statement about data availability can be helpful.
3.  **Provide a clearer call to action:** Guide the user on what to do next.
4.  **Formatting:** Make the available tickers easy to read.

Here are a few options, from concise to more detailed:

---

**Option 1 (Concise & Helpful):**

> **Sorry, I couldn't find any ratio data for AAPL.**
>
> This might be due to current data availability.
>
> However, I **do** have ratio data for the following tickers:
> `AAL`, `AAP`, `ABBV`, `ABC`, `ABT`, `ADI`, `ADM`, `AEE`, `AEP`, `ALB`
>
> Please let me know if you'd like to check any of these instead!

---

**Option 2 (Slightly more formal/detailed):**

> **Unable to retrieve ratio data for AAPL.**
>
> Our current dataset does not include this information for AAPL at this time.
>
> Ratio data is available for the following tickers:
>
> *   AAL
> *   AAP
> *   ABBV
> *   ABC
> *   ABT
> *   ADI
> *   ADM
> *   AEE
> *   AEP
> *   ALB
>
> Would you like to proceed with one of the available tickers?

---

**Option 3 (Very friendly):**

> **Oh no! I couldn't locate any ratio data for AAPL right now.**
>
> Sometimes, specific data isn't immediately available.
>
> But don't worry, I can help you with these tickers that *do* have ratio data:
> `AAL`, `AAP`, `ABBV`, `ABC`, `ABT`, `ADI`, `ADM`, `AEE`, `AEP`, `ALB`
>
> Just tell me which one you'd like to check!

**Key improvements common to these options:**

*   **Softer opening:** "Sorry," "Unable to retrieve," "Oh no!"
*   **Brief explanation:** "due to current data availability," "dataset does not include this information," "specific data isn't immediately available."
*   **Positive framing:** "However, I *do* have data," "Ratio data is available."
*   **Clear Call to Action:** "Please let me know if you'd like to check any of these," "Would you like to proceed with one of the available tickers?" "Just tell me which one you'd like to check!"
*   **Readability of tickers:** Using backticks for a single line or a bulleted list.
