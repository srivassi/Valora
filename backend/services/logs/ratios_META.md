### Gemini Response:
You're right, it appears that ratio data for **META (Meta Platforms)** is not currently available within the system you're querying.

The system indicates that **META** is not among the supported tickers for ratio data.

You can, however, retrieve ratio data for the following companies:

*   **AAL** (American Airlines Group)
*   **AAP** (Advance Auto Parts)
*   **ABBV** (AbbVie)
*   **ABC** (AmerisourceBergen)
*   **ABT** (Abbott Laboratories)
*   **ADI** (Analog Devices)
*   **ADM** (Archer-Daniels-Midland)
*   **AEE** (Ameren)
*   **AEP** (American Electric Power)
*   **ALB** (Albemarle Corporation)

Please let me know if you'd like to look up data for one of these available tickers!
