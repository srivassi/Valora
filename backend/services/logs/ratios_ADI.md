### Gemini Response:
Here's an evaluation of ADI's financial performance:

*   Liquidity is strong and notably improved by 2016.
*   Profit margins (net, gross, operating) are consistently high.
*   Return on Assets (ROA) is strong and shows improvement.
*   **Red Flag:** ROE is consistently negative, despite high profitability.
*   **Major Red Flag:** Debt ratios and interest coverage are consistently negative.
*   **Major Red Flag:** Efficiency ratios (asset, inventory turnover) are consistently negative.

**Investor Summary:**
ADI demonstrates strong liquidity and impressive profit margins. However, consistently negative equity returns, debt metrics, and efficiency ratios indicate significant underlying financial structural issues or data anomalies requiring extreme caution.
