### Gemini Response:
Financial Analysis: AAPL vs. MSFT

**Critical Constraint:** The provided "Summary of key financials" states "No recent data" for both AAPL and MSFT. Without specific financial figures, a comparative financial analysis across liquidity, profitability, solvency, and efficiency is not possible.

Therefore, I cannot provide the requested breakdown or identify a stronger firm based on financial metrics.

*   **Liquidity:** Cannot assess short-term cash flow or asset convertibility without data.
*   **Profitability:** Cannot analyze revenue, gross margins, or net income trends without data.
*   **Solvency:** Cannot evaluate debt levels or long-term financial health without data.
*   **Efficiency:** Cannot measure asset utilization or operational performance without data.

**Stronger Firm:** Cannot be determined due to the absence of financial data.

**Investor Verdict:**
No financial verdict possible without specific performance metrics.
Review current filings before making any investment decisions.
